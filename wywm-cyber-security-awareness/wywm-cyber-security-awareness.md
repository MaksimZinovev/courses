## Information security

Unauthorised Access
A person gains logical or physical access without permission to a network, system, application, data, or other resource.

Unauthorised Use
Any computer activities for which the computer and network may and may not be used or which contravenes an Acceptable Use Policy.

Unauthorised Disclosure
An event involving the exposure of information to entities not authorised access to the information.

Unauthorised Disruption
An unplanned event that causes the general system or major application to be inoperable for an unacceptable length of time

Unauthorised Modification
Modification or change to data that is unauthorized. Also known as "data tampering"

Unauthorised Destruction
The process of overwriting, erasing, or physically destroying information (e.g., a cryptographic key) so that it cannot be recovered.

## Myths

- "I'm safe. I don't visit unsecure websites."
- "Security software is the only protection I need."
- "I'm not the typical target."
- "I'll know if my information is compromised."

## What can you do

- password manager
- software updates
- stop, think, click

## Email scams

- Spam
- Phishing
- Spoofing
- "MalSpam" - delivers malware to your device.

## Malware Programs

> A program that is covertly inserted into another program with the intent to destroy data, run destructive or intrusive programs, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system.

Types of Malware

- ransomware
- spyware
- virus
- worm
- trojan
- rootkit
- keylogger

Ransomware

It is a form of malware that locks you out of your device and/or encrypts your files, then forces you to pay a ransom to regain access.

Spyware

Spyware is malware that secretly observes the computer user’s activities without permission and reports it to the software’s author.

Virus

A virus self-replicates by inserting copies of itself into host programs or data files. Viruses are often triggered through user interaction, such as opening a file or running a program.

Worm

A worm is a self-replicating, self-contained program that usually executes itself without user intervention.

Trojan

A 'Trojan horse' is a self-contained, nonreplicating program that, while appearing to be benign, actually has a hidden malicious purpose. Trojan horses either replace existing files with malicious versions or add new malicious files to hosts. They often deliver other attacker tools to hosts.

Rootkit

A rootkit is a form of malware that provides the attacker with administrator privileges on the infected system, also known as “root” access. Typically, it is also designed to stay hidden from the user, other software on the system, and the operating system itself. Similar to Spyware.

Keylogger

A keylogger is malware that records all the user’s keystrokes on the keyboard, typically storing the gathered information and sending it to the attacker, who is seeking sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card details.

## How to Protect Yourself

It pays to stop and think critically about protection strategies. Below are some easy-to-remember examples of how you can better protect yourself against malware:

Don't click on unknown links
Unknown or unsolicited links may contain malicious malware or direct you somewhere which does.

Don't visit unknown websites
Websites that could be able to infect your system, or don't have the correct security certificates are a potential risk.

Don't insert unknown USB drives into your computer
A common attack method that hinges on people being curious by nature. Leaving a USB stick outside a target building nearly guarantees the attacker's payload reaches the target system.

Apply security updates promptly
Security researchers and experts spend hours searching for vulnerabilities, These updates may protect your system from the latest malware toolkit or exploit.

Use anti-virus software
While anti-virus software is not foolproof it will protect most system and alert you to potential threats early.

## Top Threats to Wireless Security

- rogue access points
- rogue clients
- "evil twin" access point
- misconfigured access points
- ad-hoc networks

## How to Stay Secure on a Public Network

- use VPN
- use https sites
- log out of unencrypted sites


## Data breach 

> The loss of control, compromise, unauthorised disclosure, unauthorised acquisition, or any similar occurrence where: a person other than an authorised user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable information, or an authorised user accesses personally identifiable information for another than authorised purpose
>

Causes of data breach 

- network device hacking 
- malicious insider threat 
- stolen device 
- unauthorised sharing 

## How to Stay Safe on Social Media

- strong password 
- enable privacy settings
- enable MFA
- be selective what you post

## Overall security measures

- think before you click
- keep software up to date
- use secure passwords
- use MFA
- backup data
- check your physical surroundings
